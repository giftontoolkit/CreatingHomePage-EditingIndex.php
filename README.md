# Creating Home Page by Editing index.php located in theme folder

## Version 1 (v1):

- **heading**, **paragraph** in `index.php`
- CSS classes are written in `style.css`
- `style.css` file is called in index.php

### Problems in v1

- Both `header` and `foooter` code is written index.php. but the code should be in `header.php` and `footer.php`.
- CSS file is not called in `functions.php`. But it is called in `index.php`.
